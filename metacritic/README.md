##metacritic

A work in progress... Each notebook shows how I go through and figure out how a website "works" as I build a scraper. 

The [first notebook][1] deals with the list page, where I get a bunch of links and some preliminary information. 

The [second notebook][2] goes into detail getting information on each element (movie).
